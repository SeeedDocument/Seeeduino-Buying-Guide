## How to make a choice
**Seeeduino Mega :** If you want a board which has enough pins to control, ok ,Mega totally meet you demand. 70 digital pins plus 14 analog pins. In the pursuit for small form factor, flexibility and functionality comes Seeeduino Mega - derived from Arduino Mega it harnesses the power of ATmega2560 to spice up your project building experience. For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Mega/)

**Seeeduino Lotus :** Since we found that our grove interface is popular, we decided to make a seeeduino board contains more grove interface.So here it is, seeeduino Lotus has 12 grove interface including digital、analog、UART、I2C.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Lotus/)

**Seeeduino :** Seeeduino V4.2 is an Arduino-compatible board, which is based on ATmga328P MCU. There're so many Arduinos and Arduino-compatible boards in the world, and we think that Seeeduino V4.2 is one of the best Arduinos, Seeeduino V4.2 is much more stable, easy-to-use and even good looking.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_v4.2/)

**Seeeduino Ethernet :** Seeeduino Ethernet is a compact and multifunctional development platform, which merges data logging and processing, device control and Ethernet communication together into one. It's armed with a MEGA328P chip and a Wiz5100: the former provides an Arduino controlling style and the latter provides TCP and UDP Ethernet communication ability.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Ethernet/)

 **Seeeduino Stalker :** If you are going to make an outdoor data-logging application, you will find that Seeeduino Stalker is the best board.The main purpose of creating this series is to create an X-bee carrier board so that users can make outdoor application more conveniently.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Stalker_V3.1/)

 **Seeeduino GPRS :** Seeeduino GPRS is a IoT panel, you can connect to the internet through GPRS wireless network with it. Making/answering voice calls and sending/receiving SMS messages are also supported. Meanwhile, Seeeduino GPRS supports FM radio function Dand bluetooth communication.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_GPRS/)

 **Seeeduino Lite ：** Seeeduino Lite shares many similarities with Arduino Leonardo. It is a microcontroller board based on Atmega32U4 chip. The chip has about the same amount of flash, RAM and capability as the ATmega328 found in the Seeeduino.Seeeduino Lite differs from all Arduino boards in that the voltage select switch affects the I/O output voltage, high level of I/O output is consistent with voltage switch.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Lite/)

 **Seeeduino Cloud ：** Seeeduino Cloud is a microcontroller board based on Dragino WiFi IoT module HE and ATmega32u4.  Seeeduino Cloud has built-in Ethernet and WiFi support, a USB-A port which makes it very suitable for those prototype design that need network connection and mass storage. It is also a good idea to make Seeeduino Cloud to be an IoT gateway.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_Cloud/)

 **Seeeduino LoRaWAN ：** Seeeduino LoRaWAN is an Arduino development board with LoRaWan protocol embeded, through which you can get started quickly to experience LoRa's advantage in the field of IoT.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_LoRAWAN/)

 **Seeeduino LoRaWAN W/GPS :** Seeeduino LoRaWAN W/GPS is an Arduino development board with LoRaWan protocol and GPS function embeded, through which you can get started quickly to experience LoRa's advantage in the field of IoT.For more information, please click [here](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Seeeduino_LoRAWAN/)
